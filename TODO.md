# TODO — commoner-analyse

## Current

- [ ] Fix FDA: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access → add Claude Code binary
- [ ] Wait for partial-recall corpus filter fix before using `corpus="folder"` in MCP queries
- [ ] Import `notes/neva-bihar-citations.ris` into Zotero (File → Import)
- [ ] Verify Bihar first session date (22 July 1937) + Ram Dayalu Singh as Speaker — primary source before op-ed publication
- [ ] Search sansad.in written answers for NeVA year-wise expenditure by state

## Future

### NeVA / state assemblies
- [ ] Assam crawl — 14 sessions, only other state with question data — run via
      `commoner-probe state-assembly` (acquisition delegated there as of 2026-07-06)
- [ ] Semantic/intelligence layer: OCR pipeline (two-path Shruti/Shree), translation, embeddings, answer extraction
- [ ] Test H1-H6 hypotheses against PDF answers (`notes/gujarat-assembly15-hypotheses.md`)
- [ ] Expand to UP (`upvs.neva.gov.in`) — largest state, highest volume — via `commoner-probe state-assembly`
- [ ] Expand to Haryana (`hrla.neva.gov.in`) — via `commoner-probe state-assembly`
- [ ] Run `commoner-probe state-assembly-probe --include-councils` across all 37 portals for a
      real coverage report (supersedes the old "move recon script to neva_probe.py" plan — that
      coverage-probe capability now ships natively in commoner-probe, no local script needed)
- [ ] File RTI: MoPA — year-wise funds released per state under NeVA CSS 2019-26
- [ ] File RTI: Bihar Vidhan Sabha — status of pre-2022 paper records, digitization plan
- [ ] File RTI: NIC — status of vidhansabha.bih.nic.in data (migrating or abandoned?)
- [ ] Check Wayback Machine: vidhansabha.bih.nic.in snapshots 2010–2019
- [ ] Op-ed: finish verify checklist then share (notes/op-ed-draft-bihar-hollowtech.md)
- [ ] Publish `notes/neva-api-public-draft.md` once ≥10 states verified

### Central parliament (pre-existing)
- [ ] regex_v2 coverage audit (reference corpora, measure delta from ~28%) — needs
      reference corpora not available in a code-only pass
- [ ] CPR Accountability Initiative adapter (JS-rendered, RSS route preferred) —
      **architecture flag:** this is new acquisition/scraping code; per
      `_org/architecture.md`'s Layer 0/2 split, this repo owns zero acquisition
      code. Belongs in `commoner-probe`, not here — check its CHANGELOG/README
      first, then scope there.
- [ ] TECHDEBT: topic_hash propagation into analysis_discourse.jsonl — `analyse_discourse()`
      currently has no topic-profile parameter at all (unlike mp_summary/ministry_summary),
      so this is a signature/CLI-flag addition, not a one-line fix; scope as its own task
- [ ] TECHDEBT: Channel enum (`CHANNEL_QA`/`CHANNEL_COMMITTEE` are string constants in
      discourse.py; a real enum would give type-checking over the channel value at both
      classify and aggregate call sites — not yet started)
